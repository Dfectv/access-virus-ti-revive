# Access file formats (own description, from analysis)

The Access plug-in is data-driven. Its files are read at runtime from the user's installation (src/access):
Windows / Wine: PE resources of "Virus Control.dll", types `XML` (7) and `PNG` (438); macOS: files in
"Virus Control.bundle/Contents/Resources" (same names). Nothing of them is stored in this repository.

## remotedevice.xml (ISO-8859-1) - device model, root `<Remotedevice device version releasedate>`

- `ParameterSets/ParameterSet name=G/Parameter` - one parameter, key `G/name`: `minValue maxValue defaultValue`,
  `valuelist` (name of a value list), `part` (`all`, ...), `condition` (name of a condition: visibility/active),
  `defaultmessage` (id of the MIDI message that carries it), `controllerindex`, `shortname`, `displayname`,
  optional `automatable="true"`, `performanceCtrl`. 79 sets, 587 parameters (TI Desktop/Polar/Keyboard, v7.2).
- `Valuelists/Valuelist name type=plain|mapped/Entry index [value]` text = display text of a value; mapped lists
  carry an extra `value` (order/alias).
- `Conditionsets/Condition name operand=or|and result=normal|invert/Test type=inside|equals minvalue maxvalue param`.
  Several `Condition` elements can share a name.
- `MIDIMessages/MIDIMessage id name/byte index type content [tag] [mask shift] [part] [method startindex stopindex]`:
  - `content`: `controller` (0xB0|ch), `polypressure` (0xA0|ch), `sysexstart`/`sysexend`, `byte` (fixed value =
    `tag`, decimal), `deviceid`, `part`, `controllerid` (its `<parameter mapindex content>` children map the
    parameter id inside this message to parameter paths - several paths can share an index), `value`, or a
    parameter path (dumps: one byte per parameter, bit fields via `mask`/`shift`), checksum bytes (`method`).
  - ids: `cc` (page A, 151 parameters), `pp` (page B via poly pressure, 114), `Bank A (70) Single-1` ..
    `Bank G (74) Intern` (parameter SysEx `F0 00 20 33 01 <dev> <page> <part> <id> <value> F7`, pages 0x6E-0x74),
    `VirusC_Singledump` (259 bytes), `VirusTI_Singledump` (447), `VirusTI_MultiDump` (300).
  - verified: `Global Master/Mode` = `F0 00 20 33 01 10 73 00 7A 00 F7` - the original sends exactly this at start.
- `SoftknobMapping/Mapping index parameter` - soft-knob destination list.
- `Initialisation/GlobalInit param value`, `ParamInit param part value` - what the plug-in sets on the device.

## automation.xml - DAW automation ids

`AutomationList/Automation Parameter Part Index`: `Index` IS the original plug-in's VST3 ParamID (part 2 Filter 1
Cutoff = 793, part blocks of 640). 2672 entries; 2671 of them are exactly the original's mapped parameter ids
(listed with vtihost VTI_LISTPARAMS: 10404 parameters, 2703 mapped). The other 32 mapped ids are Aftertouch and
Pitchbend per MIDI channel (IMidiMapping targets, ids 0x100000+ch*0x1000 .. ). -> The rewrite can rebuild the
original's parameter list (and so load projects / automation) from automation.xml + these 32.

Verified with the original (scripted automation through process(), broker trace): ParamID 153 (Filter 1/Cutoff,
part 1) 0.0/0.5/1.0 -> `B0 28 00` / `B0 28 40` / `B0 28 7F` (value = round(norm * 127)); ParamID 128 (Amp
Envelope/Attack) 0.75 -> `B0 3B 5F`. ParamID 156 (Filter 2/Cutoff) 0.25 sent NOTHING (to explain: probably Filters/
Cutoff Link on -> filter 2 follows filter 1). On plug-in close the original resets globals (73 00 3B/3A/3C/7A).

## editor.xml - the UI (VSTGUI-style), root `<Editor>`

- `Prototypes`: 36 control classes with default colours/size - standard (Container, PatchContainer, StaticText,
  Knob/MaskedKnob/Vertical-/Horizontal-/Inverse*Knob, Vertical-/HorizontalSlider, VUSlider, Button, KickButton,
  DblClkButton, URLButton, RadioButton, Inc/DecButton, Menu, HierarchicMenu, TextEdit, TextSlider, NameEdit,
  SearchEdit) and Virus-specific (PatchBrowser, RemoteBrowser, ADSTREnvelope, ArpEdit, OscClassicShape,
  OscHypersawShape, LP4/HP4/BP4/BS4Response filter curves, WebDisplay).
- `Bitmaps/bmpNNNNN Name="X.png" Tile=/TileInsetRect` - 404 bitmap entries (id -> PNG name, tiling insets).
- `Frame/Container ...` - 20 top-level containers (header, page area, right border, pages); every element:
  `Part` (-1 = current part), `Style`, `Tag`, `Name`, `Parameter` (device parameter path, or editor state
  `VirusControl/...`), `NormalBack`/`PressedBack`/`DisabledBack` (PNG names; knob = vertical filmstrip),
  `Condition` (visibility/enable, conditions from remotedevice.xml or editordevice.xml), `Enabled`, `Transparent`,
  text attributes (`Align FontSize FontStyle ControlFont Shadow`), `OnValue` (radio buttons), child `BackColor`,
  `ForeColor` (rgba), `Size left top width height` (relative to the parent).
  Counts: 298 knobs, 158 radio buttons, 109 buttons, 91 menus, 119 containers, 72 static texts, 33 patch containers.
- editordevice.xml (not yet analysed): editor-internal parameters such as `VirusControl/SelectedPage`.

## Still to describe
editor.xml / editordevice.xml (UI), automation.xml (DAW automation ids), the "PR" variants.

## Plug-in state (VST3 component getState; the controller has none) - captured with vtihost VTI_SAVESTATE

Same container as the cache files: "MIDI" + u32 big-endian length of the rest, then records (u32 big-endian length +
one MIDI message). The state IS the list of messages the plug-in sends to the Virus when a project loads:
1. an empty record (length 0),
2. the multi dump `11 00 00` (267 B; the fixed "MultiCtrl!" table, see protocol.md),
3. 16 single dumps `10 00 <part>` (524 B, bank 0 = edit buffer of part 1..16),
4. globals as parameter SysEx (default project: `73 00 2D 02` twice),
5. 224 CCs: controllers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 for channels 1..16 (CC7 = 100, CC8 = 64,
   CC11 = 127, others 0 in the default project).
Default project: 10329 bytes. The rewrite reads and writes exactly this format -> projects saved with the original
load in the rewrite and vice versa.

## VST3 identity and parameter list of the original (vtihost class listing, VTI_LISTPARAMS)
- One single-component class per product (no separate controller class). The listing printed the raw TUID bytes:
  "Virus TI" B49F90D9735F4305AC5397BE8958CD31, "Virus TI Snow" 0B384C1BEADB40679E8EEEE233A98C9C (TI Revive's wrapper:
  byte 15 XOR 0x5A). As FUIDs (what hosts store and moduleinfo.json lists; Windows TUIDs are COM-ordered, E221):
  "Virus TI" D9909FB45F730543AC5397BE8958CD31, "Virus TI Snow" 1B4C380BDBEA67409E8EEEE233A98C9C.
- 10404 parameters; mapped (automatable) = 2671 from automation.xml + 32 MIDI-mapping targets (per channel ch 0..15:
  0x100000 + ch*0x1000 + 0x80 Aftertouch, + 0x81 Pitchbend, default 0.5). Title "[<part>] <shortname>", unit "Part NN/".
  automation.xml is keyed by (parameter, part), later entries win - which is why id 1574 (typo Part="4") is unmapped.
  `vtimodel automation` reproduces all 2671 titles byte-identically.

## A new instance's state (what the native plug-in builds, R3)
- From the user's plug-in binary at runtime: the init single (" -Init-", stored as bank 5 / program 127, format version
  8) and the "MultiCtrl!" multi (AccessFiles::init_single / init_multi; Windows DLL file offsets 0x1c46b0 / 0x1c48c0).
- Parts: init upgraded to version 9 (RemoteDevice::upgrade_single, see "Single dump format versions"; versions 10-12 only
  for bank-0 dumps), bank 0 / part n, checksums. The original's own default parts differ in 17 legacy bytes (zeroed old
  chorus/delay area etc.) - the sound is the same init patch; the Virus upgrades what it receives to version 12.
- The state's multi = the start-up table with bytes 25..40 and the checksum zeroed (as the original stores it).
- Then `73 00 2D 02` twice (Global Surround/Output Control 2/3 = 2) and the 224 controller defaults.

## Single dump format versions (what an upgrade to the current format does)

A single dump (524 bytes) carries its format version in byte 9. Older patches (personal libraries, Virus C
conversions, the plug-in's built-in init patch at version 8) are brought to the current format before they go to the
Virus. Offsets below are counted from byte 9 ("p"): p 0x00..0xFF are pages A and B (A = controller 0..127, B = poly
pressure 0..127), p 0x101..0x200 pages C and D (SysEx pages 6E/6F). Each version step applies to patches below that
version; a step only adds or moves fields, it never touches the sound-relevant bytes of earlier steps.

| to version | change |
|---|---|
| 1 | tempo 0x39; filter keyfollow base 0x24; oscillator 1 keyfollow 0x60; LFO 1/2 and delay clocks off; LFO 3 fade-in 0; soft knob 1 destination off |
| 2 | chorus feedback becomes bipolar: new = old / 2 + 64 |
| 3 | p 0x26 cleared; LFO 3 clock off; LFO 1/2 assign target off, amounts centred (0x40) |
| 4 | smooth mode 1; analog boost intensity 0, tune 0x20 |
| 5 | oscillator 2 FM mode, input follower, input ring modulator, categories 1/2 cleared; delay colour and noise colour centred; delay mode 1; oscillator 3 off (volume and semitone centred, detune 0x28); LFO 1/2 contour centred unless the LFO shape is 1; phaser defaults (stages 3, mix 0, rate 0x24, depth 0x70, frequency 0x30, feedback 0x40, spread 0x7F); soft knob 1/2 destinations renumbered: a destination d > 0 becomes d + 13, or d - 0x45 when d + 13 would pass 0x52 |
| 6 | expression 127; surround balance 0; arpeggiator pattern 0, note length centred, swing 0; arpeggiator clock: 4 when the old p 0x81 is 0, else clock 3 becomes clock 4 with pattern 1 |
| 7 | assign slots 4..6: source 3, destination 0, amount centred; EQ mid gain/frequency/Q 0x40/0x47/0x33, low/high gain centred, low/high frequency 0x2B/0x55; soft knob names 1/2 and p 0xFE cleared |
| 8 | pages C and D appear (p 0x101..0x200 from the plug-in's default page C/D); LFO 3 rate (p 0x87) 0x30 when LFO 3's assign amount (p 0x8C) is 0, no assign slot source (slots 1..6) is 0x17 and no assign destination (slot 1, 2a, 2b, 3a..3c, 4..6) or LFO 1/2 assign target is 0x3A; the delay section splits into delay and reverb (delay mode p 0x70 = c): for c = 2..4 (the old reverb modes) the reverb takes the old delay fields - reverb mode c - 1, send = delay send, type = delay LFO depth, time = delay LFO rate, damping = delay LFO shape, colour = delay colour, predelay = delay time, clock = delay clock, feedback = delay feedback; otherwise modes above 4 shift down by 3 and the reverb gets its defaults (mode 1, send 0, type 2, time 0x50, damping 0x14, colour 0x31, predelay 0x1C, clock 0, feedback 0); for c = 0 and c = 2..4 the delay gets its defaults (mode 1, send 0, time 0x40, feedback 0, LFO rate 0x28, LFO depth 6, LFO shape 1, colour 0x40, clock 0) |
| 9 | wavetable formant shift of oscillators 1/2 centred unless the oscillator mode is 4 or more; p 0xFE above 1 cleared; tape delay ratio 3, left/right clock 4/2, bandwidth 0; analog boost type 0; delay type 0; distortion treble booster, high cut 0, mix 0x7F; filter bank type 0, mix 0x7F, frequency and stereo phase centred, shape L/R 0x7F |
| 10 (edit buffer only) | oscillator select above 1 cleared; distortion quality 0x7F for distortion types below 0x12, tone centred below 0x14; filter bank resonance centred for filter bank types below 3 |
| 11 (edit buffer only) | chorus type 1, mix 0x7F, crossover 0, p 0x80 centred; ring modulator volume takes the old value at p 0x26; unison block (6 bytes at p 0x1F9) takes the old 6 bytes at p 0x61; arpeggiator mode takes the old value at p 0x81 |
| 12 (edit buffer only) | envelope 3 and 4 (10 bytes at p 0x151): attack 0x14, decay 0x46, sustain 0, slope 0, release 0x46, twice |

Versions 10..12 are only written into edit-buffer dumps (bank byte 7 = 0); stored patches stay at version 9 and the
Virus' firmware converts them. Without the default page C/D, patches below version 8 are left unchanged. After an
upgrade both checksums are recomputed: byte 265 = sum of bytes 5..264 & 0x7F, byte 522 = sum of bytes 5..521
(including byte 265) & 0x7F. Checked by tests/test_upgrade.cpp (3080 generated dumps, all versions).

## editor rendering rules (verified against a screenshot of the original, Easy page 97.0 % identical pixels)
- Knob/slider bitmaps are vertical filmstrips: frames = bitmap height / control height, frame = (v-min)/(max-min).
- RadioButton/Button: NormalBack is a 2-frame strip (0 = off, 1 = selected); PressedBack only while held.
- VUSlider (part strip): NormalBack = 53-frame MIDI activity meter (frame 0 empty .. 52 full; the original's
  "ShowMIDIActivityMeters": per MIDI channel the highest note-on velocity, -1 per editor idle tick; the plug-in's
  fixed multi maps part n to channel n), NormalHandle at (w - handle width) * volume; children of a PatchContainer
  inherit its Part.
- Align="No Label": no text (the bitmap carries it, e.g. CATEGORY, LOAD/SAVE).
- Conditions the original evaluates in code: "VirusControl/Browser/Category Filter (Not) Selected" (filter != 0),
  "Internal System Info/Display Recall Progress" (false outside a recall).
- Category filter: menu = editordevice "Val Name Category Filter" (All + alphabetical); its entry value is the
  category byte stored in the patch (Piano = index 16, stored 18). Search: live, case-insensitive substring of the
  patch name. Like the original (decompile: repository "Search Results", URL search://; user screenshots): search
  text and/or category collect the matching patches of all banks, sorted by name (byte order, duplicates kept), in
  pages of 128 in the UPPER browser ("Browser 0/Selected Bank"; the lower one is "Browser 1"). Title
  "Search Results/" + `Category is "Piano"` | `Name contains "pi"` | `Name contains "pi" and category is "Piano"` +
  ` (page 1 of N)`; the bank arrows page. Sources = device RAM + device ROM + ALL Personal Libraries including
  subfolders (the installer's "Virus TI/TI2/Snow Factory Backup/Rom/*.mid"); copies of one sound count once, key =
  dump bytes 11..264 (page A without its first two bytes). Verified: Piano = 70 entries with exactly the original's
  9 doubles (HalfliteBC, Poly5thmi@, EP+Faze, EP3DosNyt@, CuttaD6, D50-50, Funk-U, SineLang, EP Res).
- Personal Libraries: recursive; folders are submenus in the bank and LOAD/SAVE menus.
- LCD: "VirusControl/Display Original Value" = "[value when editing of this parameter started]"; the category filter
  shows as "Repository Actions Category Filter" / name / [before] / Part n. Cleared, browser 0 returns to its bank. Our popup (E194) ticks
  the current entry.
- Inactive controls (the parameter's own `condition` false, e.g. Chorus Mix with chorus off, Live Mode while the
  sequencer runs; soft knobs without destination) are painted with alpha 0.4.
- Text: bitmap fonts FNT_LCD_5x7_*.png = 96 glyphs (ASCII 32..127) of 6x9 in a vertical strip; StaticText shows its
  Name, TextSlider/Menu the valuelist text (an existing entry wins even if empty: live displays stay blank),
  NameEdit the part's patch name (Single Patch Name/Character 01..10).
- Bitmaps with Tile="true" are nine-part images: TileInsetRect = fixed borders, the middle repeats to the control
  size; text of such controls (menus) is laid out inside the left/right insets.
- Open: the big Filter 1 cutoff ring (MaskedKnob KNB_Cutoff_Rot_Uni) is not drawn by the original at rest; filter
  response displays (LP4/HP4/BP4/BS4Response -> probably KXYControl in the decompile), envelope (KEnvelope), osc
  shapes (KOscClassicShape/KOscHypersawShape), step sequencer (KStepSequencer) are custom drawn.

## ROM banks (firmware.bin) - verified: 26 banks x 128 = 3328 dumps identical to the original's cache
firmware.bin (next to Virus Control.dll / in the Mac Common folder) is an IFF FORM: TABL (chunk names) + chunks
0001..; the device images vti.bin (TI), vti_2.bin (TI2), vti_snow.bin (Snow) are FORMs of 32 KB flash sectors:
35842/35840-byte chunks = 512 records of 70 bytes with 32 data bytes at +3 and +38 (0x8000-byte chunks are raw).
ROM bank i = sectors P(064+2i) (programs 0-63) and P(065+2i) (64-127), 512 bytes per patch = page A + page B; the dump
is header 10 <5+i> <prog>, page A, add7, page B, add7, F7. TI and TI2 ROMs differ -> model from the USB device
descriptor (bcdDevice 0x100 = TI or Snow by product string, 0x300 = TI2). Banks V..Z of the TI2 are "Empty".
- OscHypersawShape (OSC page, HyperSaw mode): one 1-px line per saw in ForeColor over the element's height: centre
  x + w/2, then alternating right/left at floor(k * w), w = 2 + DetuneSpread * 2.625 / 64; saws from Density
  (0 -> 1, 32 -> 2, 64 -> 3, 96 -> 5, 112 -> 7, 127 -> 9, linear); a fractional saw = shorter line from the bottom
  (fraction * h). Pixel-identical for 8 density/spread pairs. (An earlier version ignored Density: its captures
  were made while vtimodel setdump let Shape - same byte - overwrite Density.)
- ArpEdit (ARP page, pattern User): 32 cells of 20 px, first cell 1 px inside the element; a step with Bitfield 1
  shows a bar from the bottom row (y + h - 1), height = Velocity px, ForeColor fill at ~38 %, frame (192,192,192).
  Width: right frame at cell + r, r = table(Length) (0:0 8:2 16:3 24:4 32:5 40:6 48:7 56:8 64:10 72:11 80:12 88:13
  96:14 112:16 120:18 127:18, interpolated) times the span (the step plus the following steps that are off).
  Matches the original pixel for pixel (test pattern with 16 lengths + the default alternating pattern).
- Meta parameters (editordevice.xml meta="true", 26 of them): filter link (Filters/Select 2 <-> VirusControl Links/
  Filter Link via maps) and its linked knobs, vocoder/LFO links, the FX delay/reverb on/off switches (Switch, Helper,
  Trigger On/Off with retrigger + catchAlways=false), the LFO clock menus (LFO n Clock/Divider). Engine: a source
  client (no nosource) sets the meta value (maps or (v-b)/a), the meta passes it to its trigger clients (no
  notrigger; maps or a*m+b, clamped) while its condition holds; retrigger metas fire when their condition becomes
  true; catchAlways="false" metas only catch while their condition holds. Changes from the Virus and loaded states
  update only the editor side; UI/host changes also go to the Virus. "part all" editor parameters are per part.
