// dumppacer.h - a single dump on cable 3 goes out in pieces, with the DAW's events in between on cable 5.
//
// Why: the original writes a patch dump (524 bytes = 700 bytes of USB-MIDI packets) in pieces of 64 bytes, one
// every 6-12 ms (~130 ms per dump, also when the patches change fast; never two dumps at once), and sends its notes, clock ticks and time stamps between them on cable 5 (capture of a patch change
// while another part plays, E270). Cable 3 reaches only the Virus' host CPU, which parses the dump byte by byte;
// cable 2 would put a note's bytes into that parse (one parser for all cables but 5, E252), cable 5 goes to the DSPs
// only. Written in one piece, the dump held the notes until the Virus had taken all of it, and the other parts
// stopped for a moment (E269). Queued messages wait until the dump is out (they go on cable 2).
